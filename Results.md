# Results
In all tests `insertion sort` was faster than any other sort algorithm.
`Megre sort`, `quick sort` were written with recursion usage. So they are
much slower then others. `Quick sort` is implemented in 2 ways. We can notice
that comparing elements of array with random element is better and more rational.
